[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EUDAT-B2SHARE/b2share.svg?branch=b2share-next)](https://travis-ci.org/EUDAT-B2SHARE/b2share)

B2SHARE is an user-friendly, secure, robust, reliable, and trusted service to share and store your **research data**. B2SHARE is able to add value to your research data via (domain tailored) metadata, and assigning Persistent Identifiers [PIDs](http://www.pidconsortium.eu/) to ensure long-lasting access and references. B2SHARE is one of the B2 services developed via [EUDAT](http://www.eudat.eu/)

**Deposit and release your data** via the generic interface, or select a community extension including domain-specific metadata fields. **Share your data** with others in a safe and trusted environment. **Scientific communities** are able to brand templates, and use their own collections with specific metadata.

B2SHARE is based on [Invenio](http://invenio-software.org/). Invenio enables you to run your own electronic preprint server, your own online library catalogue or a digital document system on the web. It complies with the Open Archive Initiative metadata harvesting protocol and uses [MARC21](http://www.loc.gov/marc/) as its underlying bibliographic standard.
