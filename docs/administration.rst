Administration
==============

SuperAdministrator
------------------

The superadministrator right allows a particular user to run any B2SHARE
operation. Please be careful in assigning it.

All operations below will try to identify the user based on the email address.
The user must have logged in into B2SHARE at least once, otherwise the email
address will not be found in the database.

**Add superadministrator rights**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share access allow -e <email_address_of_user> superuser-access

**Revoke superadministrator rights**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share access remove -e <email_address_of_user> superuser-access

**List existing rights**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share access show -e <email_address_of_user>


Communities
-----------

B2SHARE has special command-line interface (CLI) commands to create and edit
communities.

To **list all communities**, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share communities list

To **create a community**, make sure that B2SHARE_UI_PATH is defined in your
environment and points to the b2share ``.../webui/app`` folder, and
then run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share communities create <name> <description> <logo_file_name>

The <logo_file_name> parameter must be the filename of an image file, already
located in the ``$B2SHARE_UI_PATH/img/communities/`` directory.

To **edit a community**, use the ``b2share communities edit`` command, with
the necessary arguments. For more information run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share communities edit --help

After a community name or description is updated, please make sure to also run
the following command, which synchronizes the list of communities with the
OAI-PMH declared sets:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share oai update_sets

Community Admin
---------------

Each B2SHARE record is assigned to a community. A community administrator has
certain special rights, like the right to edit a published record's metadata
and the right to add members to the community.

To **assign the community administrator role for a user**, do the following:

1. Find the unique ID of the community, using the HTTP API, by going to
https://YOUR_B2SHARE/api/communities (for example, the community id can be
``8d963a295e19492b8cfe97da4f54fad2``). The administrator role for this
community will be ``com:COMMUNITY_ID:admin`` (please use the actual community
id between colons).

2. Run the following b2share command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share roles add <email_address_of_user> com:COMMUNITY_ID:admin

CLI for community mgt
---------------------
1. Create a community 
.. code-block:: console
    $ b2share communities create NAME DESCRIPTION FILE

File can be some webformat logo.

2. Create a schema (look in demo/b2share_demo/data/communities for inspiration)
   $ b2share communities set_schema COMMUNITY SCHEMAFILE
   
Note: you can also look in tests/b2share_functional_tests/data/testschema.py
Note: you can also do
.. code-block:: console
  $ b2share schemas block_schema list    #to obtain ID
  $ b2share schemas block_schema_version_generate_json BLOCK_SCHEMA_ID 

The last command generates a schema that you can adapt according to the rules of json_schema.


Fine-grained access controls
----------------------------

Warning: Please only run the following commands if instructed to do so by a B2SHARE representative:

1. Allow the community administrator role to update record metadata (this is
enabled by default when a community is created):

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share access allow -r com:COMMUNITY_ID:admin update-record-metadata -a '{"community":"COMMUNITY_ID_WITH_DASHES"}'

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ b2share access allow -r com:8d963a295e19492b8cfe97da4f54fad2:admin update-record-metadata -a '{"community":"8d963a29-5e19-492b-8cfe-97da4f54fad2"}'
