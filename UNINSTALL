2. Detailed instructions for the patient Invenio admin
===================================================

      $ cd /usr/local/src/invenio-0.90

          Change to the directory where you have configured and built
          the Invenio.

      $ make uninstall     ## NOTE: This has not been tested yet!!

          This will uninstall all the installed web pages, binary
          scripts and database utilities from their respective
          directories.

          Note that it may happen that you will need to clean manually
          some directories and files that may have been added under
          @prefix@.

      $ cd ..

          Go to the parent directory.

      $ rm -rf invenio-0.90.tar.gz invenio-0.90

          Wipe out the downloaded tarball and all the Invenio sources.

      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> DROP DATABASE invenio;
          mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON invenio.* FROM invenio@webserver.domain.com;

          Ask your MySQL administrator to execute the above commands
          to drop Invenio databases and to revoke access rights
          from the Invenio user.

Thanks for testing Invenio.  We would be glad to hear from you
about your Invenio experience.  Please tell us what you think to
help us to improve the system.  Thanks!
