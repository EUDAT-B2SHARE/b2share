Synopsis
========

Researchers often hold a large number of small files, like spread-sheet files with research data or analysis results, which may contain important data but do not easily fit in with regular data management and often end up being stored on personal computers, laptops or offline disk drives. EUDAT provides the B2SHARE service with the purpose of allowing registered users to upload smaller scientific data collections. The B2SHARE service is intended for researchers who do not have adequate facilities for storing and sharing data, cannot guarantee long-term persistence of their locally stored data and lack means to easily share such data with colleagues worldwide.

B2SHARE is a web-based service for storing and sharing small data sets, intended for European scientists. The service utilises other EUDAT services for reliability and data retention, while storing the data at trusted repositories with national backing, in order to provide a professionally managed and supported IT environment. B2SHARE service providers have agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding with the EUDAT consortium and keep the data accessible for at least 2 years. In the unlikely event that the service will be terminated, the service provider has the obligation to announce this at least one month in advance, and all deposited data and metadata will either be kept accessible or handed over to another EUDAT service provider so that the service can be continued. Monitoring of the service is provided via the EUDAT central monitoring facilities.

B2SHARE is designed to be easy to use and currently supports access restrictions, registration of a PID for any uploaded data object, add on of checksums and transition of all metadata information to the EUDAT metadata search. Importantly, B2SHARE enforces the inclusion of metadata accompanying the deposited data, so as to increase the value and facilitate sharing of your assets. As a default, uploaded materials are published with open access. Although access can be restricted at the time of upload, EUDAT strongly encourages open access to research data in accordance with the policy of the European Commission.

How to access the B2SHARE service

Usage
=====

B2SHARE is a graphical, web-based tool, which is designed to be self-explanatory. Some basic functionalities are explained below.

Search and download
-------------------

Registered and unregistered users can use the search field on the B2SHARE home page. Enter text in the search field and click the "Search" button. The text entered can be part of a title, keyword, abstract or any other metadata. Unregistered users can only search for data sets that are publicly accessible.
By clicking the down-pointing arrow to the right of the search field, a more specific search form will open as shown in the screenshot below. This form is for specifying search queries and has two search modes, simple and advanced. The default search mode is simple search, which provides an input box where your queries can be typed, followed by a possibility to choose one of the common indexes to search within. Usually it is sufficient to just type some keywords one is interested in and hit return.
For advanced search, it is possible to specify search fields, use boolean methods in various indices and use regular expressions and other search operators (spans, refersto, citedby). An extensive search guide is available by clicking the question mark to the left of the search field in the top bar.

Files can be downloaded either by clicking on the download symbol to the right of each item in the search result list or by first clicking on a title in the search result page and then click on the download-button in the displayed view.

It is also possible to browse the B2SHARE content. The browse page can be reached either by clicking the "Search"-button while the search field is left empty, or by clicking the "Browse"-button on the drop-down search form.

Register as a user
------------------

Users must register in order to upload and share data. To register, go to the [registration page](https://b2share.eudat.eu/youraccount/register) on the B2SHARE website. In the form you are required to include your e-mail address, a user name and password and then click the button "Sign up".  An email will be sent to the account that you specify to validate the registration.

Log in
------

To log in, click on the link "Login >>>" on the home page, then fill in user name and password and click the link "Login >>>" beneath the fields.

Deposit
-------

Only registered users can upload data. To upload data, first click "Deposit>>>" to the left. Sign in to B2SHARE if you haven't already.

**Deposit data in 3 steps:**

1.  Select and upload one or several data resources either by dragging and dropping from your file browser window to the field marked "Drag and drop files here" (see screnshot below), or by first clicking the button marked "Select files" and select a file to upload in the pop-up file browser window. Repeat the process for uploading more than one file. If you make a mistake, it is possible to remove the uploaded copy by clicking the dust-bin to the right of the file name. When ready, click the button marked "Start upload".

2.  Select a domain or project specific metadata set to describe the resource(s). Choose the domain or project which best fits to your data.

3.  Fill in the metadata form. Fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory. The selection of fields (and whether they are mandatory or not) that appear depends on the chosen description set. e.g. for the generic set (like in the figure below), title and description are mandatory fields, while creator, open access, licence, publisher, publication date and tags are optional. Hovering the mouse-pointer over the icon to the right of the field will show a description of the purpose of the field. Clicking the button "Add more details?" will show more metadata fields. Once you have completed the metadata, deposit the selected resource and its metadata elements by clicking the button "Deposit". The deposit takes a moment to be processed. You will get a reference URL immediately.

Uploaded files are normally downloadable by anyone. Clicking the button marked "On" in the field "Open Access" will restrict file access so files can not be downloaded by unregistered users. Metadata will always be publicly available.

Log out
-------
To explicitly log out from the service, go to the account page as described above, then click on "Logout" in the lower left corner.
