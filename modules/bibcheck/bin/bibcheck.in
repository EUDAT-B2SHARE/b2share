"""
   "bibcheck" is used to check a set of records against a
   configurable set of rules. A rule consists of a query, a
   checker and an amender. The set of records that
   match the query are checked with the checker and the records
   that don't pass the test will be passed to the amender. An
   amender can try to fix the record automatically or request a
   human to fix the record.

   The checkers and amenders are loaded via a plug-in system, so
   it's easy to add new checkers or amenders.
