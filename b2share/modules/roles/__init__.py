"""B2SHARE module providing access to user accounts


B2SHARE is accessible to anonymous users (not authenticated). However some
actions can only be performed by authenticated users.

Invenio provides the ``invenio-accounts`` module which stores in the database
user account information.

The B2SHARE module ``b2share.modules.users`` adds some features on top of
``invenio-accounts``.

* A REST API enabling to read user information and to create **REST API Access
  Tokens**. See ``b2share.modules.users.views``.

* Permission classes limiting the access to the REST API. See the
  ``b2share.modules.users.permissions`` module.

REST API Access Tokens enable a user to send authenticated requests via the
REST API. Example: ``GET /api/user/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>``. See
``invenio-oauth2server`` for more information on Access Tokens.
